<p><b>Paris: The collapse of health services in three west African countries devastated by Ebola may have caused some 11,000 additional deaths from malaria, a preventable and curable disease, researchers said Friday.</b></p><p>A further 3,900 deaths may have resulted from interruptions in the delivery of insecticide-treated bed nets, according to outbreak modelling data published in The Lancet on the eve of World Malaria Day.</p><p>This suggested the haemorrhagic fever outbreak "could have resulted in a comparable number of malaria deaths as those due to Ebola itself," said a statement issued by the medical journal.</p><p>"The ongoing Ebola epidemic in parts of West Africa largely overwhelmed already fragile healthcare systems in 2014 making adequate care for malaria impossible," said Patrick Walker from Imperial College London, the lead author of the study.</p><p>Walker and a team analysed demographic and health survey data for malaria prevention and care from 2000 to March 2014 in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.</p><p>They "removed" the effect of treatment and hospital care to estimate the potential impact.</p><p>The worst-case scenario, assuming the Ebola epidemic stopped all malaria care, yielded a 45-percent increase (1.6 million) in malaria cases in Guinea, 88 percent (1.3 million) in Sierra Leone, and 140 percent (520,000 cases) in Liberia in 2014.</p><p>An absence of clinic and hospital care would have resulted in some 5,600 deaths in Guinea, 3,900 in Sierra Leone and 1,500 in Liberia, the team estimated.</p><p>Lapses in delivery of mosquito nets could have led to another 840,000 cases.</p><p>"Our predictions highlight the true magnitude of the humanitarian impact caused by the Ebola epidemic," said Walker.</p><p>"In heavily-affected Ebola areas, the indirect impact of Ebola upon malaria deaths is likely to be of a similar magnitude to the public health burden caused by Ebola directly."</p><p>Last month, researchers cautioned about a likely surge of measles and other diseases due to interrupted vaccination campaigns in the three countries, which may culminate in a new public health emergency.</p><p>The World Health Organization says more than 26,000 people have been infected with Ebola since the outbreak began late 2013, and more than 10,800 have died.

<p><b>Miami: Bird flu is spreading among wild birds, chickens and turkeys across much of the United States but health authorities said Wednesday there is a low risk of people getting sick.</b></p><p>Since December 2014, cases of the highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza virus have spread through 16 states in the midwestern and western parts of the country, as well as some parts of Canada, infecting nearly seven million birds, according to the US Department of Agriculture.</p><p>The H5 virus in North America looks different than the H5N1 bird flu circulating in Asia, where it has jumped from birds to people, said Alicia Fry, branch medical officer at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The CDC considers the risk to the general US public to be "low at this time," she told reporters.</p><p>"That said, human infections with similar avian influenza viruses have occurred and it is possible that we may see human infections with the viruses associated with recent US bird flu outbreaks."</p><p>Most cases of human infection with bird flu have occurred when people had prolonged and close contact with infected birds.</p><p>"While we are cautiously optimistic that there will not be human cases, we must be prepared for that possibility," she added.</p><p>Health authorities are continuing to study the virus and are working on a potential vaccine that people could take.</p><p>However, the arrival of warmer weather in spring and summer could stop the virus in its tracks, at least for now.</p><p>"We know that this virus doesn´t like heat so when it gets up to a certain level of temperature this virus doesn´t survive, usually," said John Clifford, the chief veterinary officer of the US Department of Agriculture.

<p><b>Paris: form of mental training which helps people recognise the onset of depression, and control it, works as well as anti-depressants in preventing relapse, researchers said Monday.</b></p><p>Dubbed Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), the method may offer a welcome alternative for people wishing to avoid long-term use of anti-depressants, which can have unpleasant side effects like insomnia, constipation and sexual problems, said a study in The Lancet medical journal.</p><p>In a two-year trial with 424 depression sufferers in England, researchers found that MBCT users faced a "similar" risk of relapse to those on anti-depressants. </p><p>The method was not more effective than drugs, as many had hoped, but the findings nevertheless suggested "a new choice for the millions of people with recurrent depression on repeat prescriptions," said study leader Willem Kuyken, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Oxford.</p><p>Depression is often a recurring disorder, and people with a history of the ailment are frequently placed on a long-term course, typically about two years, of anti-depressants.</p><p>Previous research had shown that anti-depressants can reduce the risk of relapse by up to two-thirds when taken correctly, but dosage adherence is hugely variable.</p><p>Without treatment, as many as four out of five people relapse at some point, Kuyken said in a statement.</p><p>The side effects, however, have fuelled interest in alternative methods like MBCT.</p><p>It entails training depression sufferers to accept that negative feelings and thoughts are likely to recur, to recognise them when they do, and deal with them effectively rather than trigger a depressive spiral by dwelling on the gloomy.</p><p>The new study claims to be the first-ever, large-scale comparison between the efficacy of MBCT and anti-depressants.</p><p>The trial volunteers were randomly divided into two groups. Half continued taking their medication while the rest phased out the drugs in favour of MBCT.</p><p>The training involved eight group sessions of two hours and 15 minutes each, with daily home practice. Participants were given the option of four follow-up sessions over the following 12 months.</p><p>All 424 volunteers were assessed for a period of two years with a diagnostic tool called the "structured clinical interview", which measures mental state.</p><p>The MBCT group had a 44-percent relapse rate, the researchers found, compared to 47 percent in the group taking anti-depressants.</p><p>"As a group intervention, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy was relatively low cost compared to therapies provided on an individual basis," study co-author Sarah Byford from King´s College London said.

<p><b>GENEVA: One-fifth of the world's children are still not receiving routine life-saving vaccinations and efforts to ensure global immunisation coverage remain “far off track,” the World Health Organisation said Wednesday.</b></p><p>Nearly 22 million infants, many living in the world´s poorest countries, missed out in 2013 on the routine vaccine against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus (DTP3), WHO said, citing the latest available data.</p><p>And nearly half of them are in three countries: India, Pakistan and Nigeria.</p><p>This is of grave concern, said Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele, head of WHO´s vaccine unit, pointing out that there are still 1.5 million premature deaths due to vaccine preventable diseases each year."</p><p>"Today WHO is calling for the global community to close the immunisation gap and the unnecessary disability and deaths caused by the failure to vaccinate," he told reporters in Geneva ahead of World Immunisation Week, which starts Friday.</p><p>The world has made great strides in recent decades in raising immunisation rates -- from as low as five percent in some countries in the mid-1970s to a global average of 84 percent in 2013.</p><p>And 129 countries boast immunisation levels above 90 percent, with vaccines estimated to save as many as three million lives each year.</p><p>But Okwo-Bele warned the progress had been "plateauing" in recent years, despite a commitment in 2012 by all WHO members to a plan to ensure all children are immunised. </p><p>There are a number of reasons for the lack of progress, including the cost of vaccines, weak health systems and lack of access in poorer countries.</p><p>Armed conflicts and insecurity also limit access, as do emergencies like the west African Ebola outbreak, with recent, unverified numbers indicating that immunisation levels in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone dropped as much as 30 percent at the height of that crisis, Okwo-Bele said.</p><p>Also in developed nations, where coverage is generally high, there are pockets where rates are low, as recently emphasised by measles outbreaks in the United States and other western countries.</p><p>Researchers said last month immunisation rates as low as 50-86 percent had made the US outbreak possible.</p><p>In wealthier countries the low rates can be due to the fact that many of the deadly diseases being vaccinated against rarely appear, and are no longer feared, allowing complacency to set in.</p><p>"The vaccinations are victims of their own success," said WHO senior health advisor Philippe Duclos. </p><p>A number of parents also refuse to vaccinate their children against measles, mumps and rubella, claiming it is responsible for increasing cases of autism -- a theory repeatedly disproven by a range of studies.</p><p>WHO meanwhile said global immunisation coverage varies greatly between different kinds of vaccines, with 84 percent global coverage for DTP3, polio and measles, but only 14 percent for rotaviruses, the most common cause of severe diarrhoeal disease.</p><p>"Millions of children remain at risk of illness, disability or death because they are not getting the immunisation they need," it warned.<p></p>

<p><b>Miami: A remote tribe in the Venezuelan Amazon appears to be resistant to modern antibiotics even though its members have had barely any contact with the outside world, researchers said Friday.</b></p><p>The people, known as the Yanomami, were first spotted by air in 2008, and were visited a year later by a Venezuelan medical team that took samples from 34 of them, including skin and mouth swabs and stool samples.</p><p>To protect their privacy, the name of their village was withheld from publication.</p><p>Scientists found that the tribes people´s microbiome -- the community of bacteria, fungi and viruses that live in and on the body -- was far more diverse than seen in comparison communities of rural Venezuelans and Malawians. Their microbiome was twice as diverse as observed in a reference group of Americans.</p><p>The remote villagers are generally healthy, and that may be thanks to a microbiome that "contains perhaps the highest levels of bacterial diversity ever reported in a human group," said the study in the journal Science Advances.</p><p>While the Yanomami had some T-shirts, machetes and metal cans, suggesting some limited contact with civilization, they have not been exposed to the many elements of contemporary life that can cut down on microbes, such as eating processed foods, taking antibiotics, hand sanitizing and delivering babies by Caesarean section, scientists said.</p><p>Some microbes seemed to have a protective effect on their health, such as preventing the formation of kidney stones.</p><p>The tribespeople live in small villages, in a remote area that is accessible only by helicopter or by traveling for days in a canoe.</p><p>Researchers found no evidence of obesity or malnutrition among the people they saw, who lived on a diet that included fish, frogs, insects, plantains and a fermented melon drink made from casaba, said Maria Gloria Dominguez-Bello of the New York University School of Medicine. </p><p>However, she said no samples were taken of the tribe´s food and drink, which could reveal more about how they achieved their diverse gut flora.</p><p>"I would love to go back to the community, now that we know what we know," she said.</p><p>- ´Alarming´ antibiotic resistance -</p><p>Scientists expected to find some resistance to antibiotics in the population, because these resistance genes have existed in soil bacteria for millions of years or more, so it makes sense that they would migrate into people, too, even without antibiotic use.</p><p>What really surprised the team was the discovery that the tribespeople had nearly 30 antibiotic resistant genes that were never before known to science. </p><p>Even more, these genes were resistant to some of the world´s most recently developed synthetic antibiotics.</p><p>"It was alarming to us to find genes that would inactivate these modern synthetic drugs in the Yanomami population," said co-author Gautam Dantas from the Washington University School of Medicine.</p><p>"We see this as one more piece of clear evidence that antibiotic resistance is indeed a natural feature of the human microbiota but that it´s primed to be activated and amplified for greater resistance after antibiotic use," he told reporters.</p><p>The modern era of antibiotics began in the 1940s when penicillin quickly became a popular drug. Many more types of antibiotics were discovered and marketed from the 1950s to 1970s. Most originated in soil.</p><p>But widespread use of antibiotics in people and livestock has raised concern about an approaching era when antibiotics may not work at all, heralding the return of stubborn infections that turn fatal instead of treatable.</p><p>Already, drug-resistant superbugs are on the rise, particularly in hospitals, where they kill tens of thousands of people in the West each year.</p><p>The latest research "emphasizes the need to ramp up our research for new antibiotics because otherwise we´re going to lose this battle against infectious diseases," said Dantas.

<p><b>Niamey: A meningitis epidemic that broke out in January in Niger has killed 75 people so far, the health minister said on Thursday.</b></p><p>The total number of nationwide cases currently stand at 697, the minister Mano Aghali said on state television.</p><p>More than half of the deaths have occurred in the capital Niamey but the epidemic has spread to all regions of the country, with the exception of southeastern Diffa near the Nigerian border, he added.</p><p>A previous report showed that the epidemic had affected 345 people between January 1 and March 29, with 45 fatalities.</p><p>A vaccination campaign will begin next week in the most affected zones, said Aghali. Authorities have already distributed 13,500 doses of the vaccine.</p><p>Niger, one of the world´s poorest countries, is frequently prone to meningitis epidemics because of its position in the "meningitis belt" that stretches from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).</p><p>The disease -- an inflammation of the lining around the brain and spinal cord -- can cause death within hours. It is usually bacterial or viral and occasionally is due to fungal infections, although almost any microbe can cause it.</p><p>It is highly contagious and symptoms include a sudden rise in temperature, a stiff neck, severe headache and vomiting.

<p><b>Geneva: Real progress is being made in the fight against Ebola, but the deadly outbreak in west Africa remains a major international health emergency, the World Health Organization said Friday.</b></p><p>The UN health agency said after its fifth emergency meeting on the haemorrhagic fever that the situation in the worst-hit countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone remained a "public health emergency of international concern".</p><p>But the experts, who met Thursday, had said they "believed the risk of international spread appeared to be reducing," Bruce Aylward, who heads WHO´s Ebola response, told reporters in Geneva.</p><p>This is due to international vigilance, strict exit screening from the affected countries and especially the major efforts in those countries to rein in the spread of the virus.</p><p>The experts however took issue with "inappropriate" measures put in place by some countries, including quarantining aid workers, closing borders and cancelling flights.</p><p>Such measures not only interfere with international travel and impact local economies, but also hamper Ebola response and recovery efforts because they make it more difficult for aid workers to move in and out of the affected countries, Aylward said. </p><p>The west African countries ravaged by the virus, which has claimed nearly 10,600 lives in the past 15 months, have meanwhile made significant strides in cutting transmission, he said.</p><p>Last week, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia registered only 30 new confirmed cases, down from 82 a week earlier and 150 three weeks ago.</p><p>While Liberia, long the hardest-hit country, has registered no new cases for several weeks, Sierra Leone last week saw nine and Guinea, where the outbreak started in December 2013, counted 21.</p><p>At the height of the outbreak last September and October, Libera was registering more than 300 new cases each week.</p><p>Aylward said the significant decline in transmission "reflects real progress." </p><p>While new cases are still popping up along their coasts, the three countries appeared to be "on track" to meet their target to halt transmission completely in the interior before the rainy season begins next month, flooding roads and making it all the more difficult to bring in assistance.</p><p>But "the risks are still substantial", Aylward warned, pointing out that the deadly outbreak "began with one case", meaning a single case could potentially spark a resurgence of the disease.</p><p>While the affected countries have made great progress in improving contact tracing and in engaging with communities, dangerous behaviours like unsafe burials of contagious bodies or caring for the sick at home are still going on, he said.</p><p>Only about 50 percent of new cases in Sierra Leone last week, and less in Guinea came from lists of known contacts, which "means you don´t have complete control," Aylward added.
