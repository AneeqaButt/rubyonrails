<p>There has been a dramatic rise in the number of technology patents filed that relate to reading brainwaves.</p><p>Fewer than 400 so-called neuro-technology patents a year had been filed in 2000-09, research company SharpBrains said. But that had doubled to 800 in 2010. And 1,600 such patents had been lodged in the US in 2014.</p><p>Research company Nielsen holds the most neuro-technology patents - with 100.</p><p>Microsoft holds 89 patents for software that can assess mental states.</p><p>The expansion into non-medical uses represented a dawn of the "pervasive neuro-technology age", said SharpBrains chief executive Alvaro Fernandez.</p>
<p>"Neuro-tech has gone well beyond medicine, with non-medical corporations, often under the radar, developing neuro-technologies to enhance work and life," he added.</p><p>There has been a rise in the number of companies such as Thync, a start-up working to connect to the brain sensors that can alter mood in the same way as a coffee or energy drink.</p><p>And there are moves afoot to come up with ways of controlling video games via brainwaves - such as a collaboration between EEG headset-maker Emotiv and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).</p><p>There are also plenty of so-called neuro-marketing companies using with Electroencephalography (EEG) - a way of recording the electrical activity of the brain by placing sensors on the scalp - to try to find out what someone thinks about a new product or advert.</p><p>Matt Wall, of the Centre for Imaging Science, at Hammersmith Hospital, said: "There probably are some decent companies doing work in that space, but there are a massive number of neuro-marketing companies that have sprung up in the last few years.</p><p>"Because of the wide availability and low-cost of the EEG hardware these days, they all seek to define their [unique selling point] and intellectual property (ie patents) based on their fancy analysis techniques and claim to measure things like 'engagement' or 'interest' from EEG signals.</p><p>"Any EEG researcher knows this is absolute rubbish, but they do succeed in producing fancy sciencey-looking graphs and results that appear convincing enough for the marketing people they're selling it to."</p>

<p>More than 1,000 parts on the Airbus A350 XWB jet were 3D printed with materials that only recently became available to use with the technique.</p><p>It means the aircraft has more 3D printed parts than any other before it. </p><p>One expert said it was a significant step because new lightweight materials could be used and produced to airline safety standards.</p><p><a href="http://www.stratasys.com/" class="story-body__link-external">Stratasys</a>, which manufactured the parts, said it had reduced production time and costs. </p>

<p>The patch was released in April, but the researchers' findings were only made public this week.</p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Flaws</h2><p>One flaw would allow both local and remote attackers to "bypass signature validation checks and replace trusted Lenovo applications with malicious applications", the researchers found.</p><p>That might have exposed Lenovo users to so-called "coffee shop attacks", in which attackers hijack a connection to a public wi-fi network. </p><p>The attacker could "exploit this to swap Lenovo's executables with a malicious executable", the researchers wrote.</p><p>The other two flaws would allow attackers to gain a greater level of control over a system than they should have. </p><p>That would potentially allow them to run malicious commands, according to Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert at Surrey university. </p><p>"Lenovo have been found wanting again on the security front," he said. </p><p>"They seem to be exposing users to potential remote hacking this time."</p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">'Very disappointing'</h2><p>Prof Woodward said that, following February's reports that Lenovo had exposed users with adware installed on its systems, the latest revelations were "very disappointing". </p><p>Lenovo was building a "lamentable record for security", he added.</p><p>The firm was forced to remove hidden "Superfish" adware that had been pre-installed on its machines, potentially compromising users' security. </p><p>It offered customers a tool to remove the software, which has been likened to malware in the way it interacts with systems.</p><p>A Lenovo spokesman said that its development and security teams had worked with IOActive on the vulnerabilities it found in Lenovo's system update feature. </p><p>The researchers gave Lenovo time to fix the problems before their findings were made public.</p><p>The computer manufacturer added that users would now be prompted to install the updates. </p><p>"Alternatively, users may manually update System Update as described <a href="https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/product_security/lsu_privilege" class="story-body__link-external">in the security advisory</a>," it said.</p><p>"Lenovo recommends that all users update System Update to eliminate the vulnerabilities reported by IOActive."</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">Virtual reality firm Oculus VR says its much anticipated headset, the Rift, will go on sale to consumers within the first three months of 2016.</p><p>Until now, the firm had only sold "developer" editions that were targeted at video games creators and did not represent the Rift's final design.</p><p>Facebook bought Oculus VR for $2bn (£1.3bn) in 2014, despite it not having released a commercial product.</p><p>The release date means that HTC's rival helmet should be the first available.</p><p>The Taiwanese manufacturer has promised to sell its own virtual reality headset, the Vive, to the public before the end of the year.</p>
