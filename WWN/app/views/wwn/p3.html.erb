<p><b>NEW YORK: Rap mogul Jay Z has defended his Tidal streaming service as viable and a boon to artists after a much-criticised start to the revamped company.</b></p><p>“We are here for the long haul. Please give us a chance to grow and get better,” Jay Z wrote in one of a volley of messages Sunday on Twitter.</p><p>Jay Z earlier this year bought Tidal´s Swedish parent company Aspiro for $56 million amid the rapid growth of streaming services, such as Spotify, Rhapsody and Deezer, which allow unlimited on-demand music.</p><p>Jay Z rolled out a redesigned service on March 30 at a New York event featuring fellow stars including Madonna, Daft Punk, Kanye West and his wife Beyonce.</p><p>The artists said that they wanted to take charge of streaming´s future, amid criticism by musicians -- notably superstar Taylor Swift -- that industry leader Spotify offers insufficient compensation.</p><p>But a number of critics, including British band Mumford and Sons, voiced dismay at Tidal´s launch and especially the sight of highly paid stars complaining about payments.</p><p>Jay Z hit back and accused unnamed "big companies" of spending millions of dollars in a smear campaign against Tidal.</p><p>"Tidal pays (a) 75 percent royalty rate to ALL artists, writers and producers -- not just the founding members on stage," he wrote, saying that independent artists could keep 100 percent if they worked directly with the company.</p><p>Jay Z also proclaimed Tidal to be globally minded, saying that his cousin had moved to Nigeria to look for new talent.</p><p>Tidal has billed itself as a service for audiophiles. It uses larger, higher-quality file sizes than Spotify and, unlike the rival, does not have any free level to subscriptions.</p><p>Tidal has also offered exclusive material, including the streaming Sunday of the final concert on rocker Jack White´s acoustic tour.</p><p>Nonetheless, Tidal on Saturday ranked 1,027 among most-downloaded apps on iPhones in the United States and was number 61 among music apps, according to monitoring service App Annie.<p></p>

  <p><b>The rebooted "Star Wars" franchise hit a bump on Friday as filmmaker Josh Trank, who was selected to direct one of the upcoming standalone films, said he was stepping down from the project to pursue other "creative opportunities."</b></p><p>Trank, 30, the director of 2012's sci-fi movie "Chronicle" and the upcoming "Fantastic Four" movie, was selected to direct the second "Star Wars Anthology" due out in 2018. The three anthology films will intersect a new trilogy in the franchise, kicking off with "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" in December.</p><p>"After a year of having the incredible honour of developing with the wonderful and talented people at Lucasfilm, I'm making a personal decision to move forward on a different path," Trank said in a statement on StarWars.com.<p> <p> <p>"I've put a tremendous amount of thought into this, and I know deep down in my heart that I want to pursue some original creative opportunities."</p><p>Lucasfilm's vice president of development, Kiri Hart, added, "We are grateful for the energy and love of Star Wars that he brought to the process."</p><p>No replacement for Trank has been named yet.</p><p>"The Force Awakens," directed by J.J. Abrams, is the first of a new "Star Wars" trilogy being produced by Walt Disney Co since it purchased the franchise from Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4.05 billion. It is expected to be one of the biggest box office hits later this year, and its two trailers have already amassed millions of views amid frenzied fan interest.</p><p>"Star Wars Anthology: Rogue One," directed by Gareth Edwards and starring Felicity Jones, is the first of the standalone films and is due out in 2016.</p><p>"Star Wars," created by filmmaker George Lucas, grossed more than $4.4 billion at the worldwide box office since 1977 with six films and has become embedded in pop culture, spawning a legion of devoted fans.</p><p>Franchise stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher will all return in "The Force Awakens."<p></p>

  Avengers: Age of Ultron scores second biggest opening with $187.7 million | ENTERTAINMENT - geo.tv

  <p><b>LOS ANGELES: "Avengers: Age of Ultron" scored the second-biggest domestic opening in history this weekend, kicking off summer blockbuster season with a mammoth $187.7 million debut.</b></p><p>Globally, the film is a juggernaut, pulling in an estimated $627 million in 12 days of release. At that pace, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" should pass $1 billion, particularly after it opens in China on May 12.</p><p>One record remained tantalizingly out of grasp for Captain America, Iron Man and company, however. Going into the weekend many analysts predicted that "Avengers: Age of Ultron" would top the $207.4 million haul posted in 2012 by the first film in the super-team series. That box office high-water mark will stand... at least until "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" lands in theaters this Christmas.</p><p>Part of the issue may have been weaker reviews than the first "Avengers" film, as well as competition from the NBA playoffs, the Kentucky Derby and the hotly anticipated boxing match between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao.</p><p>The "Avengers: Age of Ultron" results are still an astonishing feat and a testament to the powerful sway that Disney and Marvel have over moviegoers around the world. The three biggest North American debuts in history are now all Marvel movies, with "Avengers: Age of Ultron" displacing "Iron Man 3" and its $174.1 million opening from its runner-up perch on the all-time list.</p><p>"It would be a shame to see headlines saying 'Avengers 2' fails by not setting opening weekend records," said Phil Contrino, vice president and chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. "This is still a massive debut, but there's something about the movie industry where people feel every weekend should set a new record."</p><p>Roughly $18 million of "Avengers'" opening weekend loot came from 364 Imax screens, while premium large format screens scored a record $13.5 million haul. The film played broadly across demographic categories. Roughly 59% of the audience was male, 41% was 25 years and older, 12% were teenagers and 22% were families. "Avengers: Age of Ultron" carries $250 million in production costs and screened in 4,276 North American locations.</p><p>Earth's Mightiest Heroes didn't leave much left over for other films in the marketplace. A vast chasm exists between the first and second place finishers on the domestic charts, with "Age of Adaline" clocking in behind "Avengers: Age of Ultron" with $6.3 million, bringing Lionsgate's romantic fantasy's total to $23.4 million.</p><p>Universal's "Furious 7" nabbed third place with $6.1 million, bringing its stateside plunder to $330.5 million. The action sequel is now the fourth highest-grossing film of all time on a worldwide basis with $1.4 billion in tickets sold.</p><p>Fourth place went to Sony's "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" at roughly $5.4 million, bringing its domestic score to $51 million, while DreamWorks Animation's "Home" came in fifth with $3.3 million pushing its total to $158.1 million.</p><p>In limited release, Fox Searchlight's "Far From the Madding Crowd" grossed $172,000 from five markets over in its opening weekend for a per screen average of $17,200. The indie label will add 19 new markets next weekend and plans to get to approximately 95 theaters by the Mother's Day weekend. Fox Searchlight used the same weekend last year to launch "Belle," another art house film pegged at older, affluent female crowds.</p><p>"It's a classic, beautifully shot period piece and we feel that it's a film that will work perfectly for Mother's Day," said Frank Rodriguez, senior vice president of distribution at Fox Searchlight.</p><p>The overall box office topped out at $227 million thanks largely to the costumed heroes. That represented a sizable 47.3% increase over the same weekend last year when "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" bowed to $91.6 million.</p>

  <p><b>MUMBAI: Bollywood star Salman Khan, known for his bulging biceps and off-camera temper tantrums, faces jail this week if convicted of drunkenly driving over sleeping homeless men 12 years ago, killing one of them.</b></p><p>Khan, star of blockbusters "Bodyguard" and "Dabangg" (Fearless), is accused of losing control of his SUV after a night of drinking rum and cocktails at an upmarket bar in India´s entertainment capital Mumbai in 2002 and fleeing the scene.</p><p>After years of court hearings and legal hold-ups, a judge in Mumbai is on Wednesday finally expected to hand down his verdict on the 49-year-old actor on charges of culpable homicide.</p><p>A household name in India with millions of fans, Khan faces up to 10 years in prison if found guilty following a trial whose every twist has been followed by the country´s media.</p><p>Public prosecutor Pradeep Gharat said he had presented the case as best he could to the Bombay sessions court judge, adding "we can only hope but cannot predict" a conviction.</p><p>"I am 100 percent confident that I have done my job and duty to the best of my ability," Gharat also told AFP on Monday.</p><p>Khan pleaded not guilty at trial, saying his driver was responsible for the late night crash in which his Toyota Land Cruiser mounted the pavement where five men were sleeping outside a bakery in the upmarket suburb of Bandra West.</p><p>A constable attached to Khan´s security detail said in his statement to police that the drunk actor lost control of the car while driving at about 90 kilometres (55 miles) an hour.</p><p>"The people were sleeping on the footpath. Salman and (his cousin) Kamaal ran away from the spot," the constable, who died in 2007 of tuberculosis, said.</p><p>One of the sleeping labourers injured in the accident said in his statement that "Salman was so drunk he fell. He stood but he fell again and then he... ran away."</p><p>But Khan´s lawyers said the action and romantic comedy star had in fact been drinking water all evening and had climbed out of the driver´s seat after the accident because the passenger side door had been damaged.</p><p>They also said the homeless man was killed during an operation to move the car, rather than the crash itself, when the bumper fell off and landed on him.</p><p>Finally, last month, his driver took the stand and said he crashed after the front left tyre burst, making steering and braking difficult.</p>

  <p><b>PARIS: The Cannes Film Festival will next week lift the curtain on 12 days of glamour, movies, deals and parties drawing the elite of the cinema world, from Hollywood honchos to arthouse auteurs.</b></p><p>Under the Riviera sun -- and high security -- some of the industry´s biggest stars, directors and producers will be turning out to tread the red carpet during the May 13-24 event.</p><p>Cate Blanchett, Matthew McConaughey, Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, Colin Farrell, Michael Caine, Jane Fonda, Salma Hayek, Gerard Depardieu, Catherine Deneuve, Rachel Weisz, Jesse Eisenberg, Naomi Watts and Rooney Mara all feature in this year´s movie line-up and can be expected to appear to promote their films.</p><p>The Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, will definitely be there, as co-presidents of the jury that decides the festival´s prestigious Palme d´Or prize. Other jury members include actors Jake Gyllenhaal, Sienna Miller and Sophie Marceau.</p><p><b>´Mad Max: Fury Road´</b></p><p>The movies in competition range from Hollywood-style fare, in the form of "Sicario", about a CIA operation to bring down a Mexican drug lord, to Asian martial arts in "The Assassin", to a Hungarian take on the Holocaust in "Son of Saul".</p><p>Some out-of-competition projections, though, are more widely anticipated. <p>Among them is "Mad Max: Fury Road", a sci-fi dystopian desert-carnage reboot of the franchise that made Mel Gibson famous, but which now stars British actor Tom Hardy. </p><p>Woody Allen´s latest, "Irrational Man", is also awaited, as are the big budget animations "The Little Prince" and "Inside Out", and Israeli-US actress Natalie Portman´s directorial debut, "A Tale of Love and Darkness".<p>Gaspar Noe, an Argentine director who relishes shock cinema, will be showing his movie "Love" -- suggested to be heavily pornographic, based on a movie poster he released online -- in a midnight screening.</p><p>"Amy", a documentary about British singer Amy Winehouse who died of alcohol poisoning in 2011 aged 27, will also be getting an out-of-competition midnight projection. Her family have condemned the film as "misleading" and disassociated themselves from it.</p><p><b>English becomes language of movies</b></p><p>This year, Europe easily dominates the competition field, accounting for 11 of the 19 movies vying for the golden Palme. Most of those are from a new generation of filmmakers in France and Italy.</p><p>But perhaps one of the most telling changes seen in the Cannes entries is the predominance of English. </p><p>The global lingua franca is used in several of the productions, either as a way of reaching a broader audience or to adapt to international casts, blurring the national origins of some movies.</p><p>Two of the three Italian entries, "Youth" and "The Tale of Tales", are in English, as are the sole Greek- and Norwegian-directed movies in competition, "The Lobster" and "Louder Than Bombs".</p><p>Ironically, though, not a single British movie is on this year´s list, although Cannes festival director Thierry Fremaux said "Macbeth" -- a retelling of Shakespeare´s tragedy directed by an Australian but starring German-Irish actor Michael Fassbender and French actress Marion Cotillard and filmed in Britain -- effectively stood in for the UK.</p><p></p>
