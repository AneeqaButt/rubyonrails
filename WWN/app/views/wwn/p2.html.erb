  <p><b>BARCELONA: Two late moments of Lionel Messi magic and a goal from Neymar helped Barcelona break the resistance of Bayern Munich in a pulsating 3-0 victory in their Champions League semi-final first leg at the Nou Camp on Wednesday.</b></p><p>After Barca had been frustrated by the brilliance of Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer for most of the match, Messi fired home after 77 minutes and then doubled the lead with a delightful chip from six metres three minutes later.</p><p>Neymar completed a resounding late burst from the hosts when he raced clear and slotted calmly home in stoppage time.</p><p>It was a disappointing evening for Bayern coach Pep Guardiola on his return to his former club.</p><p>He had warned before the game that it was impossible to stop his former prodigy Messi and it proved the case as the Argentine orchestrated Barcelona's emphatic victory that gives them a clear advantage heading into next week's second leg.</p><p>"When Messi is inspired he is unstoppable and tonight he showed his talent again," Barcelona centre back Gerard Pique told Spanish television.</p><p>Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben were among those sidelined in an injury crisis for Bayern, but a masked Robert Lewandowski started in attack despite fracturing his nose and jaw in his sideâ€™s recent defeat by Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup.</p><p>Barcelona's first clear sight of goal came after 11 minutes when Luis Suarez scampered clear of the Bayern defence and was denied by a superb block from the feet of Neuer.</p><p>Minutes later a close range effort from Neymar was deflected wide by Rafinha.</p><p>The German champions slowly woke up and should have scored on the counter when Lewandowski slid a Thomas Mueller cross wide after 17 minutes.</p><p>Messi and Suarez were both showing delightful touches as they teased the Bayern backline while Neymar on the left side of their attacking trident found it more difficult to get into the game.</p><p>Barca continued to pass up opportunities in the second half before Messi scored made the breakthrough with a 20-metre drive that beat Neuer at his near post.</p><p>He then capped an excellent performance by lifting the ball expertly over Neuer for a record 77th Champions League goal and providing the pass for Neymar's crucial late third.</p><p>"We played ok for long periods of time but we were caught on the break three times," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm said. "It's bitter, we had our chances but we lost possession, they break and that should not happen."</p>

  <p><b>LAS VEGAS: BritainÂ´s former two-time light-welterweight world champion Amir Khan has said he wants to be the next opponent for Floyd Mayweather after watching ringside as the American outpointed Manny Pacquiao in the Las Vegas superfight on Saturday.</b></p><p>Mayweather kept his unbeaten record with a unanimous points victory over Pacquiao in a welterweight unification showdown that failed to live up to all the pre-match hype, but fully highlighted the winnerÂ´s superb defensive skills.</p><p>Mayweather said after the fight that he would only get in the ring once more - in September - and Khan, 10 years younger at 28, believes he is ideally placed to be the AmericanÂ´s final opponent.</p><p>"I think the fight is there," Khan told BBC Radio Five LiveÂ´s Sportsweek programme.</p><p>"I spoke to Len Ellerbe, his manager, I saw him in the media room and he came over to say Â´hi...heÂ´s ready when you areÂ´.</p><p>"I think MayweatherÂ´s team are wanting the fight. But then - on the other hand - IÂ´ve even spoken to MannyÂ´s team and they said the same thing. (They said), Â´Look Amir, I think itÂ´d be good to have the fight between you and Manny nextÂ´.</p><p>"So, IÂ´m in a position where I could fight either guy but I think MayweatherÂ´s the one I want, because I really believe I have his number."</p><p>The Bolton boxer, with 30 wins and three losses to date in his career, is in action later this month in New York taking on Chris Algieri, but he hopes to get in the ring with Mayweather later this year or early in 2016.</p><p>"I think it would be an amazing fight, one that boxing fans all around are talking about because I really believe size is a big factor between me and him and the speed and the power as well. I really believe I have his number."</p><p>Early reactions to the richest fight in boxing history were mixed with Oscar de la Hoya, a former rival of both Mayweather and Pacquiao saying on Twitter: "Sorry boxing fans" and "call me old school but I like the fans getting their moneyÂ´s worth by watching an action packed fight." </p><p>Former Irish champion Barry McGuigan agreed saying on his Twitter site "boringly one-sided"</p><p>Others though praised the boxing skills of Mayweather as he took his unbeaten streak to 48 wins over 19 years.</p><p>Former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, who had picked Pacquiao to win told Sky Sports: "ItÂ´s him. ItÂ´s who he is. ItÂ´s just his time at the moment." </p><p>BritainÂ´s Lennox Lewis on Twitter said: "If U canÂ´t catch it you canÂ´t hit it #Maypac that pretty much sums up the fight."</p><p>Frank Bruno hailed Floyd Mayweather as a supreme "craftsman" of the boxing ring.</p><p>"In this generation you have to go very, very far before you can be a skilled craftsman, businessman, technician, professional and a king in knowing his craft," he told BBC Radio 5 LiveÂ´s Sportsweek programme.</p><p>"As a boxer youÂ´ve got to admire him, heÂ´s got to go down as one of the greats."</p>
