<p>For Prince Michael of Kent, driving a Hungarian Railways 1950s 'Buffalo'-class steam engine during last weekend’s inaugural Golden Eagle Danube Express journey from <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destination/hungary/121353/36-Hours-In...Budapest.html">Budapest</a> to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destination/italy/venice/33581/Venice-city-break-guide.html">Venice</a> proved more difficult than expected. “You need to do it standing up as you have to use both hands to move each lever; it’s tremendous exercise. And there’s no concession to safety at all: the floor was slippery and greasy and everything was sharp and pointed. Still, it’s a splendid machine.”</p><p>Though they will likely be pulled along by a similarly striking steam engine for part of their journey, future guests on what is being billed as mainland Europe’s first “luxury hotel train” won’t be expected to take such a hands-on approach. What was previously the Danube Express has now been taken over by Altrincham-based Golden Eagle Luxury Trains, a company that specialises in high-end, extended “land cruises” to remote locations often accessible only by rail. Its Trans-Siberian Express tours have been running through Russia for years, while <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/travel/63999/holidays-in-iran-aboard-golden-eagle-luxury-trains-jewels-of-persia-tour.html">its Jewels of Persia itinerary, launched in 2014, was the first European train journey to enter Iran</a>. New tours aboard the revitalised Danube Express will undertake extended trips to the Balkans, Transylvania and elsewhere.</p><p>For British travellers, the most conventionally lavish train journeys remain those aboard Orient Express services, where black-tie dining and immaculately restored historic interiors are hallmarks of the experience. For Golden Eagle clients, it is the promise of discovery that sets their tours apart. Guests on the company’s 12-day Balkan Explorer tours will explore destinations such as Sarajevo and Belgrade to see how recent and more ancient conflicts have changed those cities; next year’s new 14-day Heart of Persia tour will explore the ancient attractions scattered across the interior of Iran, from Mashhad’s immense Imam Reza Holy Shrine mosque to the ruins of Persepolis near Sadat Shaha.</p><p>With the grandeur of central Budapest and the city’s decrepit edges long behind us, Dave Foot, the company’s most loyal customer, explained his enthusiasm for rail travel as we chugged past ragged towns and the remarkably unremarkable plains of Hungary (intriguing though it is, this isn’t a country possessed with an immediately obvious beauty). On the 18 train tours Foot had completed with the company, it was their languorous pace and the assorted day trips on offer that enabled him fully to “understand a country, its culture and what drives its people”. The camaraderie on board was a consistent draw too – but what do you do, I asked, if you don’t like someone on board and escape isn’t an option? He assured me it had never been an issue.</p><p>Antisocial and cantankerous types will struggle to adapt to this type of holiday, however. Passengers stay either in two-berth Heritage Cabins, with shared toilet and shower facilities at either end of each carriage, or in more spacious but somewhat drab en-suite Deluxe Cabins. Resourcefully designed though they are, these are cramped spaces in which to spend a week or more – and it can take a day or two to adjust to extended rail travel. Sleep eluded many of us as the train lurched forward on the group's first – and my only – night, but old hands on board assured us that by the second night passengers adapt to the rolling rhythm of the train and rest comes more easily.</p><p>Food provides comfort in the interim. Given that staff are cooking for up to 65 diners at a time from the confines of a compressed carriage kitchen, it is generally good. Lunch might include slow-roasted pork loin with roasted vegetables and crumbly polenta cakes; dinner could be courgettes stuffed with ricotta, and venison steak with gratin dauphinois. Wine flows steadily and meals are usually followed by drinks in the lounge, where a musician might be enlisted to entertain the group.</p><p>It was there, with emotions softened by a few gin and tonics, that the enduring romance of a voyage by rail fully struck me. As a Hungarian harpist strummed, couples fell silent and linked hands. Released from everyday distractions such as Wi-Fi (deliberately absent) and television (there are two TVs, used only during occasional expert lectures) there was little to do but eat, drink, rest, read, talk and observe.</p><p>That time to ponder is what seemed to impress other passengers too. For Dave Foot, days on end were "very easily" spent simply looking out the window; for Prince Michael, the opportunity to explore new regions, do away with prejudices and open new avenues of dialogue meant extended jaunts by train were "the best way of experiencing leisure".</p><p><em>Golden Eagle Luxury Trains (0161 928 9410; <a href="http://www.goldeneagleluxurytrains.com" target="_blank">goldeneagleluxurytrains.com</a>) offers a variety of Golden Eagle Danube Express tours. Among them, the 12-day Balkan Explorer tour from Istanbul to Venice visits nine countries and costs from £6,995 per person, or from £11,295 in a Deluxe cabin. The price includes two nights at the Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul and two nights at Hotel Danieli in Venice, meals, excursions and other extras, but not flights. Some places remain on the trip departing July 11 2015. Departure dates in 2016 include June 9 and July 4.</em></p>

  <title>Inside Iran: exploring the country by train</title>

  <p>You're wanted for questioning,explained Tamas, the carriage attendant, poking his head around the door of my compartment.</p><p>At 3am, with close-cropped border guards swarming around our stationary train at Razi, entry point from eastern Turkey for Iran, that sounded ominous. I followed Tamas to an open carriage door, fearful that this sudden plunge into the pages of John Buchan or Eric Ambler might lead to some guardhouse interrogation, only to find a television crew gathered on the platform, and a little red carpet rolled out in my honour.</p><p>"You are most welcome to Iran, sir," said the reporter. "Would you mind telling us what you are looking forward to during your stay in our country?"</p><p>Mind? Some might have cried media intrusion at the uncivilised hour, but I didn’t mind, not when the questioning took place in a starlit, walnut-scented night straight out of a work by Omar Khayyam or Hafez. The lingering romance of Persia, its poets, nightingales and paradise gardens, might even have been the gist of my reply to the television reporter whose interest in a train and its passengers was as understandable as it was affecting. For the appearance of the luxury Danube Express, the first private train to enter the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution, was seen as a historic beginning for tourism in a country formerly considered off-limits to all but the most determined travellers.</p><p>War in Syria and the rise of Isil has finished tourism across much of an increasingly febrile Middle East; but in Iran, whose ideological opposition to Isils murderous Sunni zealots has eased its rapprochement with the West, the opposite has occurred. Forget the downside of this seemingly schizophrenic destination, with its alcohol ban and rigorously enforced female hijab (headscarf and coat), fulminating ayatollahs, public executions, and secretive nuclear enrichment programme. Heres a chance, finally, to experience a land thats as strong on visitor security as it is on cultural heritage, boasting more Unesco World Heritage Sites in the Middle East than anywhere else, among them those fabled gardens, Isfahans monumental Imam (formerly Naqsh-e Jahan) Square and the palace complex of the ancient Achaemenids at Persepolis.</p><p>With foreign tourist numbers set to double over 2015, however, sanction-struck Iran may struggle to provide. Expect a welcome thats unfailingly warm but a hotel sector so worn it looks like something out of <em>Argo</em>, the Ben Affleck movie set during the 1980 hostage crisis. If its any serious degree of comfort that youre after, in short, best bring your own. Which is where the Danube Express, a luxuriously appointed 64-bed hotel on wheels, comes into its own. Golden Eagle, the trains new operator, thinks so much of its latest destination that this chichi choo-choo is set to run nine Iran departures during 2015.</p>

  <title>John Simpson: Iran is the most charming country on Earth</title>

  <p>All right, so I'm a travel extremist when it comes to holidays. Don't come to me with your tales of fortnights in Dubai or <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/travel/42816/the-most-luxurious-resorts-in-the-maldives.html">the Maldives</a>: it's Afghanistan and Papua New Guinea that I'm interested in. The first thing I think of, when I hear of trouble in Egypt, is the Valley of the Kings emptying out and being able at long last to get a decent look at Tutankhamen's belongings.</p><p>This being the case, though, please don't simply disregard the country I want to suggest to you for a strenuous but immensely rewarding holiday: Iran. OK, now you’re thinking of seething crowds of angry men and black-wrapped women screaming "Death to" whoever it is this week. Stonings. Glowering ayatollahs. </p><p>These things exist, just as the danger of being hijacked in South Africa exists, or being randomly shot in America. But they aren’t the norm. They’re just what people like me put in our news reports.</p><p>So let’s start again, with a clean sheet. Think of a country, largely cut off from the outside world, with a lovely dry climate, sophisticated and charming people, superb archaeological monuments, mountains, deserts, the Caspian Sea. If recent history had been different, it would be the India of the travel business, only without the beggars and the chaos. Iran is, quite simply, the most charming country I know.</p><p>Until recently, it has been a complete secret. But in the past year or so it has opened up a little. I’ve started reading patronising little mentions of it in travel editors' diaries. A few discerning people are coming back quite starry-eyed from their visits there. Of course, there's a definite delight in shocking the neighbours, who have only been to Bali. But after the general intake of breath at the drinks party, yours will be a genuinely fascinating story.</p><p>What always strikes me in Iran is the normality of it. If you wandered down the street in Tehran – say Dr Fatemi Avenue, where the old and much-loved hotel, <a href="http://www.lalehhotel.com/" target="_blank">the Laleh</a>, stands – you would find it suspended between West and East, between the modern and something altogether older and more attractive: the Persian past. </p>
