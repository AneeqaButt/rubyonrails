  <p>Experts think they may have found proof that video games can numb pain.</p><p>It's after a man tore a tendon in his thumb while playing Candy Crush, something which is normally quite painful, but he had not realised it had happened.</p><p>The 29-year-old had been playing the game all day for six to eight weeks.</p><p>Doctors claim his injury demonstrates why some people play video games excessively, become addicted or injure themselves.</p><p>A report in the JAMA Internal Medicine describes how a right-handed man told doctors that he was experiencing "chronic pain" in his left thumb and couldn't move it properly after playing the puzzle app Candy Crush on his smartphone. </p><p>After being examined by experts, it emerged the 29-year-old from California had ruptured a tendon in his thumb and would require surgery.</p><p>The report claims this shows video games can interfere with when we feel pain, particularly when games are played excessively.</p><p>It recommends future research should look at whether pain reduction is a reason some people play repeatedly, become addicted and suffer injuries. </p><p>Dr Andrew Doan helped write the report and told <a href="http://www.livescience.com/50466-smartphone-game-injury.html" onclick='externalLinkHandler(event,this)'>Live Science</a>: "We need to be aware that certain video games can act like digital painkillers."</p><p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNewsbeat" onclick='externalLinkHandler(event,this)'>@BBCNewsbeat</a> on Twitter, <a href="http://instagram.com/bbcnewsbeat" onclick='externalLinkHandler(event,this)'>BBCNewsbeat</a> on Instagram and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Radio1Newsbeat" onclick='externalLinkHandler(event,this)'>Radio1Newsbeat</a> on YouTube.</p>

  <title>OnLive gaming service to switch off after Sony deal</title>
  <img src="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/media/images/82104000/jpg/_82104067_e69a20a4-cdfd-4ff2-aa0c-cbbba4acba11.jpg"/>
  <p>It brings to an end a troubled five years of service.</p><p>In 2012, many of OnLive's staff lost their jobs when the company was sold to a venture capital firm after running up about $40m in debt. </p><p>Several of the biggest publishers had refused to support it, although the business had proven that gaming was possible without too much delay between a user pressing a gamepad button and their character responding. </p><p>Interest was also limited by the fact users needed a relatively fast broadband connection. </p><p>In addition, many PC owners seemed to prefer buying games from Steam and other online marketplaces, rather than paying a monthly subscription fee for a Netflix-like "all-you-can-eat" experience.</p><p>In March 2014, the company announced a new direction with the launch of CloudLift, a facility that let gamers stream and play select titles they had bought from Steam on mobile devices, TVs and other computers.</p><figure class="media-landscape full-width has-caption"</p>
