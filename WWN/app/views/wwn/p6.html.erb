  <title>Latest News, Breaking News,   Pakistan gets first women-only auto-rickshaw - EPakistanNews.com</title>
  <img src="http://www.epakistannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pink-Rickshaw-in-Lahore-150x150.jpg" alt="Pink Rickshaw in Lahore" width="150" height="150" />
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pakistan, Lahore News : A Pakistani environmentalist, fed up with being groped and harassed by male auto-rickshaw drivers, has launched her own service exclusively for women passengers and drivers in her home city of Lahore &#8211; with just the one rickshaw on the road so far.</strong></p>
  <p>Zar Aslam, president of Pakistan&#8217;s non-profit Environment Protection Fund, said she once narrowly escaped kidnapping by a rickshaw driver when she was a student, which triggered the idea of launching her &#8220;Pink Rickshaw&#8221; service.</p>
  <p>&#8220;This is another step towards women&#8217;s financial and professional empowerment,&#8221; Aslam told Reuters at her home in Lahore, showing off her first rickshaw.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I and my co-workers face harassment by male auto drivers or by passersby while waiting for public transport.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The &#8220;rickshaws&#8221; are covered three-wheel motorcycles and Aslam bought one to start with, added fans, doors and headlights and painted it pink and white.</p>
  <p>The plan is to have at least 25 up and running by the end of the year, with the Aslam looking out for sponsors.</p>
  <p>&#8220;One auto costs 300,000 rupees (about $3,000), therefore it cannot be done without sponsorship from donors,&#8221; she said, adding that the government has not offered any assistance.</p>
