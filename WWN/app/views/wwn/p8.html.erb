  <title>Fitch: UK Faces Fiscal Continuity, Constitutional Uncertainty</title>

<p><p>(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
  LONDON, May 08 (Fitch) The UK general election result reduces
  near-term
  uncertainty about fiscal policy, but raises long-term
  constitutional issues,
  Fitch Ratings says.
  The narrow Conservative majority gives greater, but not
  complete, clarity on the
  future path of fiscal consolidation. Both the Conservative and
  Labour parties
  were committed to reducing the fiscal deficit in the next
  parliament, and
  supported the fiscal mandate set out in the Charter for Budget
  Stability. But
  the prospect of a hung parliament, to which opinion polls had
  been pointing
  throughout the campaign, and possibly a minority government, had
  raised the risk
  that making and implementing fiscal policy would become more
  difficult.
  The Conservatives have said they aim to balance the cyclically
  adjusted current
  budget by 2017-2018, two years earlier than Labour's
  pre-election commitment,
  and using a different balance of revenue and spending measures.
  Consolidation
  therefore looks set to continue broadly in line with the March
  budget and Office
  for Budget Responsibility (OBR) projections. But certain details
  of the
  Conservative programme, such as the composition of planned
  welfare cuts, remain
  to be spelt out.
  The fiscal mandate, particularly the five-year rolling deficit
  target, provides
  substantial flexibility, giving future governments the option to
  avoid
  pro-cyclical fiscal tightening in response to weaker economic
  conditions. But
  this flexibility may be hindered by pre-election commitments to
  protect large
  categories of spending and rule out rises in several major tax
  categories.
  The OBR enhances fiscal transparency and credibility, increasing
  political
  incentives to correct budgetary imbalances. But missing or
  delaying targets for
  the cyclically adjusted current deficit could reduce fiscal
  credibility, in our
  view.
  UK debt to GDP remains among the highest of 'AA' and 'AAA'
  category sovereigns.
  Further deficit reduction that resulted in a lower and steadily
  declining
  government debt ratio would support the UK rating at 'AA+'.
  The election will increase pressures for lasting broader
  constitutional reform,
  particularly after the Scottish National Party won 56 seats in
  Scotland.
  Negotiations about devolution of fiscal responsibility to
  Scotland will further
  complicate the fiscal picture. The final arrangement is still
  unknown but
  Scotland's relatively small share of the UK economy (around 10%)
  means the
  resulting fiscal risks to the UK are likely to be manageable.
  The UK starts from
  a position of relative strength in fiscal policymaking. We would
  not expect the
  overall fiscal framework to be significantly weakened by further
  fiscal
  devolution.
  But its slim majority could present a political challenge for
  the new
  administration as it seeks to implement its fiscal, UK
  constitutional, and
  European policy agenda. UK constitutional reform will need
  cross-party support,
  and the government could face internal dissent over Europe.
  David Cameron has promised an "in-out" referendum on the UK's EU
  membership by
  the end of 2017, after a loosely defined renegotiation. A firm
  judgement on the
  sovereign credit impact of the UK leaving the EU (opinion polls
  indicate
  meaningful support for membership) is not possible at this
  stage, because the
  terms of the exit scenario are highly uncertain. Negotiating the
  shape of a UK
  exit would be lengthy and complicated, and a wide variety of
  outcomes are
  possible. This prolonged uncertainty could dent UK economic
  growth by weighing
  on confidence and investment.

  <p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> U.S. job growth rebounded last month and the unemployment rate dropped to a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent, signs of a pick-up in economic momentum that could keep the Federal Reserve on track to hike interest rates this year.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"></span><p>Nonfarm payrolls increased 223,000 as gains in services sector jobs offset weakness in mining, the Labor Department said on Friday. The one-tenth of a percentage point decline in the unemployment rate to its lowest level since May 2008 came even as more people piled into the labor market. </p><span id="midArticle_2"></span><p>The report, which showed steady but tepid gains in hourly earnings, suggested underlying strength in the economy at the start of the second quarter after a bad stumble in the first three months of the year.</p><span id="midArticle_3"></span><p>Still, March payrolls were revised to show only 85,000 jobs created, the fewest since June 2012.
