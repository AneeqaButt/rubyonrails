<p class="story-body__introduction">An artwork that gets your feet wet is about to be unveiled in Venice at the 56th International Biennale. It's the national pavilion of the tiny Pacific nation of Tuvalu, which will be one of the first places in the world to disappear if sea levels continue to rise.</p><p>"It's a sinking nation combined with a sinking city," says the pavilion's creator, Taiwanese eco-artist Vincent Huang.</p><p>"This is the first floating pavilion in the Venice biennale's 120-year history."</p><p>Inside, a turquoise pool is crossed by two black walkways.</p><p>They give a little under our feet and the water seeps in, wetting the soles of our shoes. The idea is that the weight of the people on the walkways will cause this kind of "flooding", symbolically reproducing the impact of human beings on the environment.</p>

<p>Huang carefully chose the colour for the wooden pool's PVC lining, reproducing the exact shade of the "beautiful crystal blue of the Tuvalu lagoon".</p><p>"Tuvalu is the smallest national pavilion but we're dealing with the biggest global crisis," says Huang.</p><p>"I believe that most people have never heard about Tuvalu but it's an iconic victim in terms of climate crisis." </p>

<p>In keeping with Huang's policies, this is the Venice biennale's first PaperSmart pavilion - no information is available in paper form, only digitally. The money saved will help to fund a mangrove-planting project to combat coastal erosion, which he describes as "a social sculpture involving the people of Tuvalu".</p><p>The pool is filled with local tap water, which will be filtered to prevent it from stagnating over the coming six months. Huang had originally hoped to use water from Venice's lagoon but permission was refused for hygiene reasons. </p><p>A fog machine creates misty reflections on the water, mixing at times with the natural light filtering through the windows or with a projected light to create an aurora effect. The aurora is a metaphor for modern civilization which, in Huang's words "looks beautiful but is just an illusion which disappears quickly."</p>
