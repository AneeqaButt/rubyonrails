<p>Two partial skeletons unearthed in northeastern China have dashed the record for the oldest avian relatives of today's birds.</p><p>The remains belonged to a species, <em>Archaeornithura meemannae</em>, that lived 130.7 million years ago — about 6 million years earlier than the previous record holders. Fossil hunters discovered bones of the hummingbird-sized creatures embedded in siltstone slabs in what may have once been a lake. Stubby feathers stipple the ancient birds' bodies, except for some spots on the legs. These bald patches hint that the animals once waded through watery homes,  Chinese Academy of Sciences paleontologist Min Wang and colleagues May 5 </p>

  <title>Scientists take first picture of thunder | Science News</title>

  <p>MONTREAL — For the first time, scientists have precisely captured a map of the boisterous bang radiating from a lightning strike. The work could reveal the energies involved in powering some of nature’s flashiest light shows.</p><p>As electric current rapidly flows from a negatively charged cloud to the ground below, the lightning rapidly heats and expands the surrounding air, generating sonic shock waves. While scientists have a basic understanding of thunder’s origins, they lack a detailed picture of the physics powering the crashes and rumbles.</p><p><a name="anchor" id="anchor"></a>Heliophysicist Maher Dayeh of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio and colleagues sparked their own lightning by firing a long, Kevlar-coated copper wire into an electrically charged cloud using a small rocket. The resulting lightning followed the conductive wire to the ground. Using 15 sensitive microphones laid out 95 meters from the strike zone, Dayeh said he and his colleagues precisely recorded the incoming sound waves. Because sound waves from higher elevations took longer to reach the microphones, the scientists could create an acoustic map of the lightning strike with “surprising detail,” Dayeh said. He <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/ja2015/meetingapp.cgi#Paper/36014">presented</a> the results May 5 at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union and other organizations.</p><p>The loudness of a thunderclap depends on the peak electric current flowing through the lightning, the researchers found. This discovery could one day allow scientists to use thunder to sound out the amount of energy powering a lightning strike, Dayeh said.</p>

  <title>How did Earth get its water?  | Science News</title>

  <p>Earth — a planet of oceans, rivers and rainforests — grew up in an interplanetary desert.</p><p>When the solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago, shards of calcium- and aluminum-rich minerals stuck together, building ever-larger pebbles and boulders that smashed together and assembled the rocky planets, including Earth.</p><p>But Earth’s signature ingredient was nowhere to be found. Heat from the young sun vaporized any ice that dared to come near the inner planets. Earth’s relatively feeble gravity couldn’t grab on to the water vapor, or any other gas for that matter. And yet, today, Earth is a planet that runs on H<sub>2</sub>O. Water regulates the climate, shapes and reshapes the landscape and is essential to life. At birth, humans are about 78 percent water — basically a sack of the wet stuff.</p>

  <title>Possible nearest living relatives to complex life found in seafloor mud | Science News</title>

  <p>Cold mud from the seafloor has revealed signs of a new group of microbes that could be the nearest living relatives yet found to the domain of life that includes people and other creatures with fancy cell structures.</p><p>That mud carries DNA of a previously unknown and unusual phylum of one-celled microbes, researchers <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature14447">report</a> online May 6 in <em>Nature</em>.</p><p>The microbes in this newly named Lokiarchaeota phylum carry the basic DNA of one-celled life called archaea, sisters to the domain of bacteria. Yet they possess roughly 100 genes that resemble those in eukaryotes, organisms with intricate structures in their cells.  </p>
